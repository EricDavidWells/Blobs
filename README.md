# Blobs

## Using a Genetic Algorithm to Evolve Simple Neural Networks that Control Blob Like Organisms in a Simulated Environment

## Install
All you need is the Processing IDE and to relocate the jblas folder

I am currently using a matrix optimization library called jblas, it is external to the processing libraries so you need to add it manually. Take the folder titled "jblas" in the included "libraries" folder, and place it in the "libraries" folder of your processing sketchbook (to find this, go to preferences on processing ide and it will say at the top). 

If you want to replace the jblas library with an improved version, replace the .jar file that is deep inside the "jblas" library folder.  I don't understand how .jar files work, so use at your own risk.  I should really just replace this library with my own matrix multiplication it can't be that much slower, sorry m8s.

This library was installed from here: http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/j/Downloadjblas123jar.htm
The documentation is here, although I couldn't get this built into a .jar file: http://www.jblas.org/
